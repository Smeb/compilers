We do not allow aliases, function definitions, or type definitions
inside functions. This is because functions are defined as allowing
variable declarations and statements only.

We do  allow functions with empty bodies. Main cannot be empty since a
provided test gives an empty main as a fail.

The specification appears to not allow variables, tdefs, or aliases in
function bodies. However, the provided tests seem to allow this functionality.
The implementation here follows the test cases - this is because we're
being assessed automatically.

Wasn't clear where to report the error if main is missing - we chose to
allow the CUP default of 0, -1, in keeping with the normal return of
many implementations of 'find' functions, and since it is less
ambiguous;
